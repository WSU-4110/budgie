# Budgie
Budgie is a budgeting app that aims to make saving and planning for the future easy and more accessible. We know it can be hard getting started on saving money. All of the tools other budgeting apps use can be confusing and unfamiliar, however our aim is to guide you along the process of financial literacy and make sure you have enough for any unpredictable event. Our application features articles that can help decipher tricky financial terms and helpful prompts so our users understand the purpose of each activity.
